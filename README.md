      <p>My name is Dandre Jackson, and I'm 19 years old. I have a passion for Parkour and motorcycles, finding joy in the adrenaline and freedom they bring. Alongside these hobbies, I also find fulfillment in coding. Exploring the intricacies of programming and creating digital solutions fuels my curiosity and creativity.</p>
      <h3 id="education-para"><span class="chap">EDUCATION</span></h3>
      <h5>Elemntary</h5>
      <p>I went to Lake Gem Elementary School, and looking back, I remember getting into lots of trouble during those years. It seemed like every week there was a new adventure or mischievous plan with my friends. From harmless pranks in the classroom to daring escapades during recess, we always found a way to keep things exciting. Of course, there were also moments of learning and growth mixed in with the mischief, but those troublemaking memories are the ones that stand out the most to me.</p>
      <h5>Middle</h5>
      <p>During my time at Howard Middle School, I found myself getting into less trouble compared to my earlier years. It was during this time that I was introduced to the fascinating world of graphic design. This new avenue of creativity opened up a whole new realm of possibilities for me.</p>
      <h5>High</h5>
      <p>During my time at Edgewater High School, I found myself getting into even less trouble than before, which was a relief. It was also during this time that I was reintroduced to HTML and CSS, which sparked my interest in coding once again. I remember diving into web development projects and discovering the creative possibilities that these languages offered. It was a pivotal moment that fueled my passion for coding and design.</p>
      <h3 id="work-para"><span class="chap">WORK</span></h3>
      <p>I work at Lockheed Martin, where I'm involved in cutting-edge aerospace projects. My role here is quite exciting, as I get to work with advanced technologies and collaborate with talented teams to solve complex engineering challenges. It's a dynamic environment that constantly pushes me to learn and grow professionally. I take pride in contributing to projects that have a significant impact on the aerospace industry and global innovation.</p>
